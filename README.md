Materials for TU Wien's programming lectures for Welcome.TU.code in the winter term 2016/17

## Oct 19:
We have learned if-else-statements and while- and for-loops.
We have learned the data type <code>double</code> and the keyword <code>final</code>.

Here, you will find:
* Cheatsheet.pdf - an overview of how the Java constructs we have learned so far work
* exercises.pdf - a collection of exercises you can do, but do not have to do
* homework.pdf - this sheet contains the homework assignemnts. (note that there is some additional homework below)
* Presentation.pdf - the presentation slides of today
* IntelliJ-Project.zip - an IntelliJ project containing all the programs we have presented in today's lecture. Plus, it contains the program named "Preview" that shows you what you will learn next lecture.

Additional homework:
* do the exercise on the for-loop from the presentation slides (slide number 11 of 12)
* try out the program named "Preview" from the IntelliJ project to see what you can do after the next lecture.
